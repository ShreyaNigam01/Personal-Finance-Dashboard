# Personal-Finance-Dashboard
The Personal Finance Dashboard created using Power BI provides a comprehensive view of income, expenses, savings, and financial trends to effectively manage personal finances.

Project Description:

The "Personal Finance Project" in Power BI is being created to provide a comprehensive view and analysis of individual's financial data. The dataset includes different sources of income, various kinds of expenditure, over the period of little more than 3 years, this project aims to help users gain insights into their personal finances. The project will enable users to track and visualize their income, expenses, and financial trends, allowing for better financial planning, budgeting, and decision-making. Ultimately, the Personal Finance Project will empower individuals to gain a clearer understanding of their financial health and take proactive steps towards achieving their financial goals.

Questions that will be answered:

What is my net worth?

Is my spending pattern right?

Am I reaching my savings target?

Which months are financially good /bad?

Where/how do I spend?

Where / how do I save?


Problem Approach:

1.	A mock dashboard was developed for the Personal Finance Project using Power BI. The project started by importing an Excel file into Power BI and utilizing Power Query to transform the data. The data was manipulated by unpivoting columns, adjusting data types, renaming columns, and creating new calculated columns to enhance the analysis. Once the data was prepared, it was loaded into Power BI to begin building the data visualizations.

3.	The dashboard focused on providing key performance indicators (KPIs) for net worth, income, percentage of expenses, and savings for specific years and the entire time period. These KPIs allowed users to quickly assess their financial status and track progress over time. To provide a comprehensive view of the data, various visualizations were utilized, including bar charts, line charts, line and stacked column chat and matrices. 

5.	To enhance the user experience, interactive tooltips were incorporated, allowing users to delve deeper into the visualization and explore details

Key Insights:

1.	The net worth accumulated over a span of three years amounts to Rs. 3,25,500
2.	Among various categories of expenses, house rent consistently accounted for the highest expenditure, while leisure activities reflected the lowest spending. 
3.	The maximum savings were observed in mutual funds, whereas the lowest savings were attributed to holding liquid cash.
4.	Notably, there has been a significant increase in funds allocated towards monthly EMIs over the three-year period.
5.	Additionally, a substantial decline in savings occurred from November 2019, which can be attributed to an upsurge in shopping expenses and EMIs. This decline may be attributed to the effects of the lockdown period and increased expenditure on online shopping.
6.	Furthermore, as time progressed and income increased, there was a noticeable decrease in the percentage of savings. To maintain a sound financial well-being, it is essential to either increase or sustain a certain percentage of savings relative to income. In the Dashboard we can see, we set the target to maintain 25% saving but failed to maintain it after Nov 2019.
